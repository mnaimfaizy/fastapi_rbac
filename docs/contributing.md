## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git** for version control
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerized development
- **Node.js 18+** for frontend development
- **Python 3.10+** for backend development
- **VS Code** (recommended) with our workspace extensions

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi_rbac.git
   cd fastapi_rbac
   ```

2. **Follow our comprehensive setup guide**:
   üìñ **[Complete Setup Guide](docs/development/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md)**

3. **Quick start with Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   # Frontend: http://localhost:80
   # Backend API: http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

4. **Install VS Code extensions**:
   - Python, Black Formatter, isort, Flake8, Mypy
   - ESLint, Prettier
   - Docker, GitLens (recommended)

## Development Guidelines

### Project Organization

- **Feature-based development**: Each feature should include backend API, frontend UI, tests, and documentation
- **API-first approach**: Design API endpoints before implementing frontend
- **Documentation-driven**: Update docs alongside code changes
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests for new features

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add password strength validation
fix(user): resolve email validation issue
docs(api): update authentication endpoints
test(user): add integration tests for user creation
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## Code Standards

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

**Code Quality Tools**:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **Flake8** for linting
- **Mypy** for type checking

**Run quality checks**:

```bash
cd backend
black .
isort .
flake8 .
mypy . --exclude alembic
```

**Key Conventions**:

- Use SQLModel's `.exec()` for all async DB queries (not `.execute()`)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add type hints to all functions
- Use Pydantic models for API schemas
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions

**Security Requirements**:

- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

**Code Quality Tools**:

- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **ESLint** for linting and import order

**Run quality checks**:

```bash
cd react-frontend
npx prettier --write .
npx eslint . --fix
```

**Key Conventions**:

- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Use Redux Toolkit for state management
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Testing Requirements

### Backend Testing

**Test Structure**:

- **Unit tests**: `backend/test/unit/` - Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: `backend/test/integration/` - Test complete workflows
- **Test utilities**: `backend/test/factories/` and `backend/test/fixtures/`

**Running Tests**:

```bash
# All tests
python backend/test_runner.py all

# Unit tests only
python backend/test_runner.py unit

# Integration tests only
python backend/test_runner.py integration

# Specific test file
python backend/test_runner.py specific --path backend/test/unit/test_crud_user.py
```

**Test Requirements**:

- All new features must include tests
- Use factories for test data creation
- Use API-driven flows for integration tests
- Mock external services (email, Redis, etc.)
- Achieve high test coverage (aim for 90%+)

### Frontend Testing

**Test Tools**:

- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **MSW** for API mocking

**Running Tests**:

```bash
cd react-frontend
npm test          # Run all tests
npm run test:ui   # Run with UI
npm run coverage  # Generate coverage report
```

**Test Requirements**:

- Test all public component interfaces
- Test user interactions and workflows
- Mock API calls and external services
- Test error states and edge cases

### Test Quality Standards

- **Write descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Use AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Keep tests independent** and idempotent
- **Use appropriate test data** via factories
- **Document complex test scenarios**

## Release Process

### Overview

This project follows a unified release notes and version tracking system. The `docs/release-notes.md` file serves as the single source of truth for all releases and major changes across the entire monorepo.

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for our releases:

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Incompatible API changes or significant new features
- **Minor Version (0.X.0)**: Backward-compatible new features and enhancements
- **Patch Version (0.0.X)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Pre-release Versions**: Suffixed with `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, or `-rc.N` (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta.1`)

### Creating a New Release

1. **Prepare the Release Notes**:

   - Update `docs/release-notes.md` with the new version
   - Include the release date and summary of changes
   - Categorize changes into "New Features", "Bug Fixes", and "Breaking Changes"
   - Ensure the content is clear and understandable for users

2. **Generate Draft Release Notes from Git History** (optional):

   - Use Git commands to extract commit messages since the last tagged release:
     ```bash
     git log <previous_tag>..<HEAD> --pretty=format:"- %s" > changelog.txt
     ```
   - Review, categorize, and edit the generated notes before adding to `docs/release-notes.md`

3. **Update Version References**:

   - Update any version references in the documentation
   - Ensure any version-specific instructions are updated

4. **Create Git Tag**:

   - Tag the release using the same version as in the release notes:
     ```bash
     git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
     ```
   - Push the tag to trigger the release workflow:
     ```bash
     git push origin vX.Y.Z
     ```

5. **Post-Release Actions**:
   - Announce the release in appropriate channels
   - Monitor deployment and application health
   - Start planning for the next release cycle
