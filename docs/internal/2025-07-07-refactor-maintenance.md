# FastAPI RBAC System: Refactor & Maintenance Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-07
**Type:** Refactor & Maintenance

## Overview

This document summarizes the major refactor and maintenance changes applied to the FastAPI RBAC project in July 2025. The focus was on production-readiness, environment isolation, Docker Compose modularity, and improved developer experience for local, test, and production environments.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Docker Compose & Environment Isolation**

- **Modular Compose Files:**

  - All environments (`dev`, `test`, `prod`) now use modular, directory-scoped Docker Compose files.
  - Compose files are parameterized with environment variables for source directories, ports, and volumes.
  - Compose files for backend and frontend are now fully decoupled and can be orchestrated via a root script or PowerShell utility.

- **External Networks:**

  - Each environment uses a dedicated, external Docker network (e.g., `fastapi_rbac_dev_network`, `fastapi_rbac_test_network`, `fastapi_rbac_prod_network`) for service isolation and cross-compose communication.

- **Volume & Data Directory Consistency:**

  - All persistent data (Postgres, Redis, PgAdmin, Celery Beat) is mapped to environment-specific directories and named volumes.
  - Data directories are now overridable via environment variables.

- **Service Naming & Ports:**
  - All service names and container names are environment-specific (e.g., `fastapi_rbac_db_dev`, `fastapi_rbac_db_test`, `fastapi_rbac_db_prod`).
  - Ports are explicitly set and non-conflicting across environments.

### 2. **Entrypoint & Startup Scripts**

- **Entrypoint Scripts Relocated:**

  - All entrypoint and service start scripts are now under `backend/scripts/docker/` for clarity.
  - Old scripts (`production-entrypoint.sh`, `development-entrypoint.sh`, `testing-entrypoint.sh`, etc.) have been removed or replaced.

- **Entrypoint Logic Improvements:**

  - All entrypoints now robustly wait for Postgres and Redis to be available before proceeding.
  - Database migrations and initial data setup are performed automatically on container start.
  - Environment variables are loaded and passed consistently.

- **Celery Worker/Beat/Flower:**
  - Worker and beat start scripts are now Docker-optimized and use the correct `PYTHONPATH`.
  - Flower and beat scripts wait for dependencies before starting.

### 3. **Database Initialization**

- **Init Scripts by Environment:**

  - Database/user initialization scripts are now split by environment under `backend/init-scripts/{dev,test,prod}/`.
  - Each environment creates only the required databases and users.
  - Test runner database is created only in test environment.

- **SQL Scripts:**
  - Legacy SQL scripts in `scripts/database/` are now only used for development and are referenced in the correct compose files.

### 4. **TLS/SSL for Redis**

- **Certificate Generation:**

  - Redis TLS certificates are now generated with proper SANs for all environments using `redis_cert.cnf`.
  - Both PowerShell and Bash scripts (`generate-certs.ps1`, `generate-certs.sh`) use the same config and logic.

- **Redis Service:**
  - All Redis services use the same version (`7.2.5-alpine`) and are configured for append-only persistence.
  - Redis certificates are mounted read-only and referenced with the correct paths in both container and app.

### 5. **Production & Test Hardening**

- **Production Compose:**

  - All production services are now directory-scoped, use non-root users, and have healthchecks.
  - PgAdmin, Redis, and Postgres are isolated and only exposed as needed.

- **Test Compose:**
  - Test environment is fully isolated, with all services using test-specific ports, volumes, and data directories.
  - Test runner and backend test services are separated for parallel and targeted test execution.

### 6. **PowerShell Environment Manager**

- **`docker-env.ps1`:**
  - New PowerShell script for unified environment management (`dev`, `test`, `prod`).
  - Supports actions: `up`, `down`, `build`, `status`, `logs`, `prune`.
  - Handles external network creation/removal and environment variable setup.

### 7. **Nginx & Frontend**

- **Nginx Upstream:**

  - Nginx config now points to the correct backend service for each environment.
  - Security headers and CORS settings updated for production.

- **Frontend Compose:**
  - Frontend compose files are modular and use environment variables for API base URL and source directory.
  - Healthchecks and hot-reload are enabled for development.

### 8. **General Clean-Up**

- **Removed Obsolete Files:**

  - Old entrypoint scripts, test runner DB scripts, and legacy compose files have been deleted.
  - All root-level Docker Compose files (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.test.yml`, `docker-compose.prod-test.yml`, etc.) have been removed. Only modular, directory-scoped compose files are now used for all environments.
  - All shell scripts are now line-ending normalized and Docker-ready.

- **Documentation:**
  - Compose files, scripts, and configs are now commented for clarity.
  - All changes are reflected in this internal documentation.

## Migration & Usage Notes

- **Always use the new PowerShell script (`docker-env.ps1`) or the modular compose files for environment management.**
- **Entrypoint scripts are now under `backend/scripts/docker/` and referenced in all Dockerfiles and compose files.**
- **For local development, use the `dev` environment; for integration tests, use `test`; for deployment, use `prod`.**
- **All persistent data is now environment-specific and safe for parallel use.**
- **See `DOCUMENTATION.md` and `README.md` for updated usage instructions.**
