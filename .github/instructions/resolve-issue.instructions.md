# Resolve Issue

## Instructions

When asked to resolve an issue, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Issue**: Read the issue description carefully to understand what the problem is.
2. **Check for Existing Solutions**: Look for any existing solutions or discussions related to the issue in the repository.
3. **Implement the Solution**: If a solution is available, implement it in the codebase. If not, create a new solution based on your understanding of the issue. But for that follow these steps:
   - Switch to main branch.
   - Pull the latest changes if any.
   - Create a new branch clearly specifying what will be fixed or resolved.
   - Checkout/Switch to the new branch.
   - Make the necessary code changes to resolve the issue.
   - Commit the changes with a clear message describing what was done to resolve the issue.
   - Push the changes to the remote repository.
4. **Test the Solution**: Ensure that the solution works as intended by running tests or manually testing the changes.
5. **Document the Changes**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made to resolve the issue.
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Once the issue is resolved, create a pull request with a clear description of the changes made and how they resolve the issue. Also include label(s) like `bug`, `enhancement`, or `documentation` as appropriate.
7. **Link the Issue**: In the pull request description, link to the issue being resolved by mentioning it (e.g., "Fixes #issue_number").
8. **Review and Merge**: After the pull request is reviewed and all the CI builds are passed and approved, merge it into the main branch.
9. **Close the Issue**: Once the pull request is merged, close the issue if it has not been closed automatically by the pull request.
10. **Follow Up**: Monitor the issue after resolution to ensure that it remains fixed and does not reoccur. If any further issues arise, address them promptly.
