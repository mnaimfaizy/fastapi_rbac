# Backend Scripts

This directory contains backend-specific helper scripts.

## Docker scripts

Scripts under `docker/` are used by Docker Compose and Dockerfiles for container startup.

## Local/dev helpers

Top-level `.sh` and `.ps1` scripts are intended for local development convenience (formatting, linting, running worker/beat/flower, etc.).
