python test_runner.py integration --coverage

# Complete test suite with coverage
python test_runner.py all --coverage --parallel

# Specific test debugging
python test_runner.py specific --path test/integration/test_api_auth_comprehensive.py --debug
```

### Using Enhanced Factories

```python
# Create test data easily
user = await user_factory.create_verified_user()
admin = await user_factory.create_admin_user()
role = await role_factory.create_role(name="manager")
```

### Using Service Mocks

```python
# Verify email functionality
assert len(email_mock.sent_emails) == 1
assert email_mock.get_last_email()["subject"] == "Verification Email"

# Check Celery task execution
assert len(celery_mock.get_task_calls("send_notification")) == 1
```

## 📋 Next Steps Recommendations
